Researcher with a passion for science and genetics. Driven to apply skills in genomics, statistics, and computer science to contribute to society. Strong foundation in statistics and currently writing a dissertation on evaluating linear mixed models for phenotypic prediction. Adept in a wide range of computational techniques from multivariate analysis, simulations, and optimization. Well-versed in analyzing data using R and writing software using Java and Python.

## Skills

**Genetics and Genomics**

Analyzed several genetic and genomic datasets for various applications such as population genetics, marker design, quantitative trait loci mapping, genome-wide association, and phenotypic predictions.

**Statistics**

Linear mixed modeling and multivariate analysis of phenotypic and genomic data. Evaluation of statistical models using cross-validation methods.

**Computer science**

Applied optimization algorithms to solve problems in the field of genetics. Written software packages in Java and Python to analyze genetic markers and an R package to correct sequence-based genotyping errors.
